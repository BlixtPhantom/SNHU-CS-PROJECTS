Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The project is a financial investment simulator designed to calculate and display the growth of an investment over a specified number of years. 
It addresses the problem of visualizing how an initial investment, with or without additional monthly deposits, grows with the application of compound interest. 
By inputting the initial investment amount, monthly deposit, annual interest rate, and the number of years, users can generate two reports: one showing the balance and interest earned without monthly deposits and another showing the balance and interest with monthly deposits.

What did you do particularly well?

I ensured that the code was structured and modular by implementing the 'Investment' class, which encapsulated all the necessary attributes and methods for the calculations and report generation. 
The use of functions like 'printChar' for printing repeated characters enhanced the readability and maintainability of the code. 
Additionally, handling user input and generating detailed, formatted reports provided a clear and user-friendly interface.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I could enhance the code by adding a better input validation that reduces runtime errors.
I could also utilize pointers to help with memory management.
These would make the code more efficient because there is less likely to be bugs if I were to use more advanced techniques in the industry for the project.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging part was ensuring accurate and precise financial calculations, especially when compounding interest monthly. 
I overcame this by thoroughly testing the calculations with known values and iterating through the logic to confirm the results. 
I utilized calculators to cross-verify the outcomes. 
Using C++ documentation and Zybooks material for the project helped with understanding and properly implementing the calculations.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Object-Oriented Programming and modular design is something that will always help in computer science. 
These are basic principles that all programmers should grasp.
These concepts will help me in the professional and academic world.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Using proper naming conventions, comments, and consistent formatting helped a lot in making it maintainable and readable not only to me but to others.
I believe if I were to show my code to someone who has never written code in their life they would be able to have a basic understanding of what it accomplishes.
